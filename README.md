# Business QA Bot (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

A robust **retrieval-augmented QA assistant** purpose-built for business policy and HR document questions. This bot uses the LangChain framework, OpenAI embeddings and models, and Pinecone vector database to provide **professional, context-informed answers** based on your own documents.

## üöÄ Features

- **Contextual Answers:** Uses company documents or handbooks to answer business, policy, and HR-related queries.
- **Retrieval-Augmented:** Finds and cites relevant document chunks to justify answers.
- **Business-Focused:** Default prompt makes it ideal for policy, benefits, HR, operations, and compliance Q&A.
- **Conversational Interface:** Simple command-line or notebook experience with suggested follow-up questions.
- **Sample Data Generation:** Includes a utility to create a sample business policy PDF for demonstration or testing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -U langchain-openai langchain-pinecone tiktoken fpdf
pip install "unstructured[md]" pdf2image pypdf
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Store your Pinecone and OpenAI API keys as environment variables or in your notebook (e.g., Colab):

```python
import os
os.environ['PINECONE_API_KEY'] = 'your-pinecone-key'
os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = 'your-openai-key'
```

### 3. Usage

**Notebook or Script Example:**

```python
# 1. Create a sample document (or use your business PDF)
policy_pdf = create_sample_policy_pdf()  # or use your own PDF

# 2. Process the document
document_chunks = load_and_split_documents(policy_pdf)

# 3. Create Pinecone vector store
vector_db = setup_vector_store('business-qa-rag', document_chunks)

# 4. Create the QA system
qa_bot = create_qa_system(vector_db)

# 5. Ask questions!
query = "What health insurance do we offer?"
result = qa_bot.invoke({"query": query})

# 6. Get answer and sources
print(result['result'])
print(format_source_documents(result['source_documents']))
```

or run the full interactive loop called in `__main__`.
